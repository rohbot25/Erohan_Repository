            Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
            The main goal of our project is to develop a sensor-based system that will allow us to accurately measure different 
            water parameters of a tank in order to optimize the growth of the hydroponic plants that utilize the solution within the 
            tank. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This would have many different applications, mainly targeting the hydroponic farming industry. However, our product 
            also includes applications to the aquarium industry, as well as civilian infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            For our project, we will be observing the levels of water within a hydroponic tank, making sure the system is restored 
            with the optimal amount of fresh water whenever needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If budget and time constraints allow, we hope to incorporate measurements of the nutrients of the system as well. 
            These metrics allow the user to optimize nutrient levels of the ecosystem with a high level of accuracy and to dose 
            the water supply accordingly. Future expansion for this project could begin with the automation of dosing, app integration, 
            and the ability to increase the number of sensor inputs.
