        <h3>What Are Hydroponics?</h3>
        <p>
            Hydroponics is a type of water-based horticulture that involves growing plants without soil. Instead of soil, the plants 
            lie in a nutrient-filled water-based solution, absorbing the minerals and water within the solution.

        <h3>Target Market</h3>
        <p>
          The market is not to the people, per se. The target market for the Salmon Bear Hydroponic Pump is farmers, 
          specifically the hydroponic farming community. This may seem as though it is a small market, but it is actually 
          quite large and is on the rise with an annual growth rate of 11.35% per year, expected to hit $18.64 billion in 2026. 
          There is a huge market in Hydroponic Farm businesses.
