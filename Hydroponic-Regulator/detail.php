        <h3>Overall Description</h3>
        <p>
            Salmon Bear's AWTO is a sensor-based system that allows the user to accurately measure different water parameters of a    
            hydroponic farm in order to optimize the growth of the ecosystem it sustains. The largest component of this process is the 
            tank where the plants are growing themselves. Our project originated from the idea of monitoring small-scale hydroponic 
            plants. In a hydroponic system, water is constantly being taken up by the plants, which is needed to be refilled on a 
            regular basis. Also, an option in hydroponic farming is to add nutrients to the water as well, which must be monitored and 
            made sure that enough is in the water at all times. Our design will allow fresh water to be added to the tank if water 
            levels are low, and be able to flush out old water and refill the tank full with new water. These functions will be able to 
            be called manually, using the control page of this website. The refill of low levels will be checked on a consistent basis 
            throughout the day and recorded whether or not water must be added to the system.
