Black Jack made by Evan Rohan

# Summary of Project
This program allows you to play the game of blackjack. 
The main runs the gameplay of the game, and Deck.h/.cpp
Deck.cpp has the creation of the deck, all input+validation, and also control
of money, the hands of the user and the house, and winner of each round.

# MODULE 1 
From module 1, I used a struct and enum to create a card struct, 
with the suit being an enum. I also used a header and a .cpp file for my class to help organization
I also used all the input validation that I learned from M1AP.

# BUGS
No bugs present

# Future Expansion
This project did not have a lot of future expansion, 
but many parts of the deck class could re-purposed for other casino games like poker.
One minor future expansion would be to validate the bet that it would have to be a real amount of money such as being only going to 2 decimals worth of money.

# Grade

I think I deserve an 100, because The job I wanted to be accomplished was completed.
I also used many concepts from module 1, and have very in depth validation, and complexity
of the main and also the functions within the class are also in depth, to make the main cleaner
and to organize all the moving pieces of the project.
Next, I have lots of comments throughout, with a robust header explaining each function.
Finally, for the rest of details, my project lifespan was appropriate, and my video is linked as well with multiple attempts.
